# Cloud Computing

This project involves deploying a web application to a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. The deployment will utilize various cloud services including databases, storage, and serverless functions. Additionally, the project includes implementing autoscaling and load balancing to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

<br/>


## Features

- __Cloud Platform Deployment__: Deploy the web application to a chosen cloud platform.
- __Cloud Service Integration__: Utilize cloud services such as databases (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP Cloud SQL), storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage), and serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions).
- __Autoscaling__: Configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of resources (e.g., instances, containers) based on traffic load.
- __Load Balancing__: Implement load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or containers.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Deployment Scripts__: Scripts for deploying the web application to the chosen cloud platform.
- __Service Integration Scripts__: Scripts for integrating cloud services such as databases, storage, and serverless functions.
- __Autoscaling Configuration__: Configuration files or scripts for setting up autoscaling.
- __Load Balancer Configuration__: Configuration files or scripts for configuring load balancing.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Cloud Platform Selection__: Choose a suitable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for deployment.
- __Web Application Deployment__: Deploy the web application using platform-specific tools or services (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, GCP App Engine).
- __Service Integration__: Integrate cloud services into the web application codebase using SDKs or APIs provided by the cloud platform.
- __Autoscaling Setup__: Configure autoscaling policies based on metrics such as CPU utilization or request latency.
- __Load Balancer Configuration__: Set up a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or containers.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Integration Testing__: Test the integration between the web application and cloud services.
- __Autoscaling Testing__: Simulate varying levels of traffic to verify autoscaling functionality.
- __Load Balancer Testing__: Test load balancing configurations to ensure even distribution of traffic.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Database Integration__: Integrate the web application with a cloud database service and verify data persistence.
- __File Storage Integration__: Use cloud storage to store user-uploaded files and verify file retrieval.
- __Serverless Function Invocation__: Invoke serverless functions in response to specific events and verify functionality.
- __Autoscaling Test__: Increase traffic to the web application and observe autoscaling in action.
- __Load Balancer Test__: Send simulated traffic to the web application and verify load balancing across instances or containers.
